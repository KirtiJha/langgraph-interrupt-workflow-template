## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### üîí Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [your-email@domain.com]
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

### üìã What to Report

Please report any of the following:
- Authentication/authorization bypasses
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- API key exposure risks
- State management security issues
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
- SQL injection (if database is added)
- Dependency vulnerabilities

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

### üèÜ Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in the security advisory
- Listed in our Hall of Fame (if desired)
- Eligible for appreciation (not monetary bounty)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use HTTPS in production
- Validate user inputs

### For Contributors
- Follow secure coding practices
- Review dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Use parameterized queries (if database is added)
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper error handling

## Known Security Considerations

### API Keys
- IBM Watson API keys are stored in environment variables
- LangChain API keys are optional but recommended for tracing
- Never expose these in client-side code

### State Management
- Conversation state is stored in memory (not persistent)
- Thread IDs are UUIDs (not predictable)
- No user authentication in demo (add for production)

### Dependencies
- Regularly updated via Dependabot
- Security advisories monitored
- Critical updates applied promptly

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production:

1. **Environment Security**:
   ```bash
   # Use secrets management
   export WATSONX_API_KEY="$(cat /secrets/watson-key)"
   ```

2. **Network Security**:
   - Use HTTPS/TLS
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add authentication/authorization
   - Configure CORS properly

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Log security events
   - Monitor for unusual patterns
   - Set up alerts for failures

4. **Updates**:
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security patch management
   - Version pinning for stability
